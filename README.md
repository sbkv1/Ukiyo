# Setup
	
You can setup ukiyo by simply opening your terminal/console and pasting in the following command:
```
python setup.py
```
Or you can install the required modules manually by pasting in the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After that, you want to open the config file(config.json) and input the following values:
- Your discord token.
- A webhook to send the information to.
